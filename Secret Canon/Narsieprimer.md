## A rough primer on Nar'sian crap (and also the galaxy at large, apparently)

    In the late 2200s, during the glorious early years of the expansion and discovery phases of mankind's 
development, there was caused a great religious resurgence. This being brought on, of course by the discoveries of wonderous new technologies, xenos species living beyond the rims of the galaxy, and all sorts of natural (and unnatural) wonders of nature and technology.

This also happened to be the perfect time for a war.

Minor factions, megacorporations, and literal terrorist groups, feeling abandoned and jealous in the neighboring arm system, banded together to form the *First Sagittarian Syndicate,* named, of course, after the galactic arm they occupied.

They swiftly began laying siege onto Terra and her glorious empire, and, as the war raged on, with millions of souls lost to the void, a god was born.

Because of the millions dying on the daily, praying for survival; the families of those soldiers, praying for safe return, and the collosal scale of the conflict, it was little suprise when little Nar'sie simply sprang, born from the wake of the war[^1]

[^1]: It would be more accurate to say reborn. Nar'sie, being an ancient, primal goddess of vague, primal characteristics and concepts can never truly die, nor be born. She simply is, just like humanity.
