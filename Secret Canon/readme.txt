### SECRET CANON ###

This is everything that is known to be FACT in regards to factions and events and will often serve as a reference
to further lore additions and changes. 
NOT ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS PUBLIC- Public knowledge is allowed to be incorrect due to lack of information.
This is everything that has been determined to be canonical, and may include information that is not public knowledge.

Referring to this should only be used if there is a conflict between something that is attempting to be made canon
and actual canon knowledge (which can be found here). In case of conflict, generally established canon will win over
attempted alterations, barring extreme circumstances.

Referring to things in this area that is -NOT- public knowledge (barring permissable exceptions) 
is considered metaknowledge and is frowned upon significantly.
