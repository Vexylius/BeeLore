--- BASIC FORMATTING GUIDELINES ---

1. Before writing anything down, make sure you know what sort of document you're going to be writing.
Is this going to be a message from Centcom? A recorded declaration of war from Nuclear Operatives?
The random scribblings of a space hobo squatting in maintenance, eating rats and looking for assistants to try and murder?

2. Once you know what sort of document you're going to be writing, take a look at either other documents here for inspiration
(note, consider making formatting templates for important things like Centcom or syndicate reports) or documents of a similar nature.

3. Follow the formatting, but in general, please consider the following.

	A. Make sure to proofread important documents to avoid potential typos or misuse of technical terms
	B. Make sure to use appropriate grammar and punctuation for the type of document being written
	(A friendly note between crew members should be casual, a report from the Captain to Centcom should -not- barring Bunny Ears Lawyering)
	C. Make sure that it -makes sense- unless it's -NOT- supposed to.

4. A grasp of tropes and writing is encouraged, but is not mandatory. Remember, the higher quality your writing is, the more likely it is to be made canon.

--- DIALOG ---

1. Try and follow SS13's chat log formatting as much as possible. For example:

	A. If the conversation happens over a radio channel, make sure to indicate -which channel the conversation is taking place on.-
	(e.g. [Common], [Supply], [AI Private], Etc...)
	B. Make sure to indicate who is speaking. Remember that someone without an ID will always show up as 'Unknown',
	but someone who doesn't have a syndicate mask or other means of disguising their voice will have their true identity show up.
	(e.g. Flinten Steele as Unknown, Hoshi Shirogane as Flinten Steele, etc...)
	
# TO DO: Gather formatting examples from SS13 chat #
